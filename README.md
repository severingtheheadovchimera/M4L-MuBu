Once opened drag & drop sample and click a point somewhere in the buffer. For some reason it takes about 10 seconds for the sound to kick in. You may need to move the period and duration knobs around a little bit if you're not getting anything, but be careful because the initial audio can be loud.

I haven't made the buffer midi mappable since I primarily use a trackpad to do buffer scanning, and you'll find that the values you get midi mapping the buffer won't be as smooth as using the trackpad. Touch Osc is a nice in-between, and I've built the possibility of using it into the inner workings of the patch, which are a mess lol.
