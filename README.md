Once opened drag and drop sample and click a point somewhere in the buffer. For some reason it takes about 10 seconds for the sound to kick in. You may need to move the grain rate and duration knobs around a little bit if you're not getting anything, but be careful because the initial audio can be loud.

I haven't made the buffer midi mappable since I primarily use a trackpad to do buffer scanning, and you'll find that the values you get midi mapping the buffer for samples over 60 seconds won't be as smooth as using the trackpad.
